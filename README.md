# Hi there and welcome to my Read.me.
## A little bit about my self.
### Firstly:
My name is Sebastian O'Brien and my user name was taken from a variation of the <br />first ever band i was in.<br />
<br />
I recently decided to change my life and make something better of myself, so now my journey into coding had begun.
I have decided to start with a boot camp course in *Python* to kick start the journey.<br />I have to saythat I wish I had done this a lot sooner as it is highly enjoyable.
