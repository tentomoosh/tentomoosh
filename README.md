# Hi there and welcome to my Read.me.
## A little bit about my self.
### Firstly:
My name is Sebastian O'Brien and my user name was taken from a variation of the <br />first ever band i was in.<br />
<br />
I recently decided to change my life and make something better of myself, so now my journey into coding has begun.<br />
I have decided to start with a boot camp course in *Python* to kick start the journey.<br />I have to say that I wish I had done this a lot sooner<br />it is highly 
enjoyable.

### Skills that I have previously gained that I hope to use:

* Strong problem solving.
* Attention to detail.
* Team work and Solo work.
* Strong artistic and musical background
* Experience in many different fields and industries outside of coding
* Ableton Live
* Lateral thinking<br />
<br /> 
# *More to follow* .....
